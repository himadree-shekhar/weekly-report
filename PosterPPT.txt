[CONTEXT SUMMARY]

GOAL:
- As a competition host, you need to create Professional Research Posters (A1/A2) from student-submitted IT project materials.
- You want to finish each poster in ~3–4 hours with a clear, minimalistic layout.
- Manual editing is too time-consuming; you're looking for automation and efficient processes.

INPUTS:
- Each student team submits a folder with: PPT, DOC, PDF, Source Code, Demo Video.

CHALLENGES:
- Text-to-image ratio and layout not consistent.
- Submitted diagrams (e.g., flowcharts) often unclear or unaligned with text, needing manual redrawing and formatting.
- Manual work takes too much time per poster.

YOUR ASK:
- A minimalistic, practical process to make high-quality research posters fast.
- Identify which parts can be automated.
- Provide a clear visual outline or flow with minimal text.
- Prefer structured, copyable formats over long explanations.

WHAT CHATGPT PROVIDED:
- A step-by-step minimalist process flow from input gathering → content extraction → visual selection → layout templating → automation → final polish.
- Visual layout grid for standard poster sections (TITLE, ABSTRACT, METHOD, RESULTS, TOOLS).
- Time-saving tips (auto-diagram, pre-built templates, Python automation).
- Sample starter code for content extraction from DOCX files.
